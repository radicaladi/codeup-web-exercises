<h2>A Few Fun Facts</h2>

<h3>Joshua Tree National Park</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Joshua Tree National Park covers 1,235 square miles and is the second-largest National Park in California, after Death Valley. What we as visitors see is only about 15% of the park area. The remaining 85% is managed as wilderness.
    </li>
    <li>
        It took Joshua Tree 58 years to become a National Park. Receiving National Monument protection in 1936, thanks to Minerva Hoyt, but it took until 1994, before the land was elevated to National Park Status.
    </li>
    <li>
        Joshua Tree is actually 3 different ecosystems. Encompassing the Colorado Desert in the south-east, the Mohave Desert in the north, and the San Bernardino Mountains to the west.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Mormons Named the tree after the Biblical Joshua, though the local Cahuilla refer to them as <em>Hunuvat Chiy’a</em>. Surprisingly enough, the tree is actually a Yucca plant.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Great Sand Dunes National Park</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        The famous sand dunes resemble an alien landscape so much that NASA uses the geological conditions to test rovers. The two Viking spacecraft that first landed on Mars proved their astronomical fortitude in the extreme environment of dunes at the national park.
    </li>
    <li>
        Great Sand Dunes protects the tallest sand dunes in North America, with the legendary Star Dune towering at 755 feet.
    </li>
    <li>
        The traditional Ute word for the Great Sand Dunes is <em>Saa waap maa nache</em>,"sand that moves." Though sand is dormant, the forces of wind and water move eroded sand from the surrounding mountains to form the sand dunes and some smaller dunes may migrate aacross the grasslands.
    </li>
    <li>
        In 2019, Great Sand Dunes became a certified International Dark Sky Park by the International Dark Sky Association. This means that the park’s rare combination of dry air, little light pollution and high elevation makes it perfect for viewing galaxies. Including our own, the Milky Way.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Grand Canyon National Park</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        The Grand Canyon is bigger than the state of Rhode Island. While the park doesn’t include the entire canyon, it does measure in at a whopping 1,904 square miles in total. In comparison, Rhode Island is around 1,212 square miles.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Grand Canyon itself can influence the weather. At an elevation spanning from around 2,000 feet to over 8,000 feet, the temperature generally increases by 5.5 degrees with each 1,000-feet loss in elevation. Allowing it to experience a variety of weather conditions
    </li>
    <li>
        The Grand Canyon has an estimated 1,000 caves, and of those, 335 have been recorded. Even fewer have been mapped or inventoried. Today, only one cave is open to the public -- <span>the Cave of the Domes on Horseshoe Mesa</span>.
    </li>
    <li class="last">
        Visiting the North Rim and South Rim in the same day may be harder than you think. To drive between them through the park, over the Colorado River and loop around the canyon, you have to travel 215 miles or about <em>5 hours</em>.
    </li>
</ul>
